# 📝 Registration Portal – React Project

The **Registration Portal** is a responsive web application built using **React.js**. It allows users to **register and log in** using client-side validation and stores the data locally using **LocalStorage**. The project serves as a beginner-friendly yet production-grade template that can be extended with real backend integration.

## 📖 About the Project

This portal offers two main features:

- **User Signup**: Collects name, email, and password, with validation.
- **User Login**: Validates credentials stored in the browser's local storage.

Once logged in, users are redirected to a basic **Home Page**, simulating a protected route. A separate component named `Counter` demonstrates simple React state handling.

The entire UI is styled using **custom CSS**, without any external UI libraries, giving you complete control over responsiveness and design.

## 🎨 Key Features

- ✔️ Functional **Signup** and **Login** forms
- 🧠 **Form validation** with error display
- 🔒 Data stored in browser **LocalStorage**
- 🔁 Component-based architecture with clean separation
- 💡 A sample `Counter.js` component to demonstrate state logic
- 🔧 `Apiservices.js` abstracted to simulate API interactions

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User Signup**:
   - Validates input fields (name, email, password).
   - Stores the user object into browser's `localStorage`.

2. **User Login**:
   - Validates against credentials in `localStorage`.
   - Redirects to the Home component upon successful login.

3. **Home.js**:
   - A basic dashboard or landing page post-login.
   - Could later include user-specific data or analytics.

4. **Counter.js**:
   - Demonstrates usage of React’s `useState`.
   - A self-contained component useful for learning state.

5. **Apiservices.js**:
   - Currently mimics API interactions using localStorage.
   - Easily upgradable to real API calls using `axios` or `fetch`.
